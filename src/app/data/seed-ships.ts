    description: 'The EX-1 Vibz is the smallest member of the EX lineup — a rapid-deployment builder drone designed for tight construction spaces and quick assembly tasks. Where larger yardships cannot safely maneuver, Vibz units swarm in through access shafts, fractured hull ribs, and half-pressurized corridors to weld new structure over old scars. Each chassis mounts dual plasma welders, magnetic manipulators, and a modular tool cradle that can be refit for lattice-printing, shielding node emplacement, or precision hull scoring. Voran site foremen deploy Vibz clouds ahead of full-scale construction groups to lay calibration anchors, diagnostic beacons, and foundation scaffolds across raw rock or derelict stations. On the frontier, the arrival of a Vibz swarm in orbit is often the first visible sign that a barren grid square has been marked for transformation into a Beyond Horizon staging point.',

Hull-mounted decoy racks and flare-drones flood local space with false signatures, leaving targeting suites chasing ghosts while the real Specter is already repositioning. Voran task forces commonly deploy Specters in “wolfpacks,” small coordinated cells that isolate stragglers, strip escorts from convoys, and bleed an enemy fleet long before a decisive battle. In the Beyond Horizon rim wars, entire campaigns were lost not to grand armadas, but to the slow, relentless attrition dictated by Specter packs.',

Fleet doctrine often assigns Phantoms to shadow dreadnoughts and carriers, twisting the sensor picture until those massive hulls seem to be everywhere and nowhere at once.

    summary: 'Powered by twin plasma cores, the Vulcan channels devastating heat-based weaponry through forward-mounted cannon arrays.',
    description: 'The VX-6C Vulcan is a heat-borne nightmare, powered by twin plasma cores that transform the vessel into a forward-thrust furnace. Those cores feed massive cannon arrays along the ship\'s prow, each shot disgorging focused thermal lances capable of burning through capital-grade armor in seconds. Thermal bleed is captured and redirected through secondary emitters, turning even the Vulcan\'s waste heat into a short-range hazard for anything reckless enough to close. When it opens fire in earnest, ships on the receiving end report sensor feeds dissolving into white, hull plating bubbling away, and the sudden, horrid realization that space itself seems to be burning. In the Beyond Horizon record, systems scarred by Vulcan bombardments are easy to recognize: their orbital lanes glitter with glassed debris.',

    summary: 'Using a solar-fusion drive and high-energy focusing lenses, the Helios delivers radiant lances that vaporize targets from orbit.',
    description: 'The VX-6D Helios wields light itself as a weapon, coupling a solar-fusion drive with high-energy focusing lenses to project radiant lances across orbital distances. Its reactors feed artificial micro-stars that are then shaped and released as coherent beams, slicing through warships, defense grids, and hardened bunkers with surgical finality. Because its primary weapons favor extreme range and line-of-sight corridors, Helios captains often operate from the periphery of engagements, acting as celestial executioners while VX frigates and destroyers herd targets into clean firing arcs. Even when idle, the vessel\'s lens arrays glow with caged radiance, earning it a reputation as a second sun hanging in hostile skies. On worlds touched by the Beyond Horizon conflict, the phrase “Daylight is here” carries a new, uneasy meaning — it might simply mean a Helios has taken station overhead.',
