      'The CXW-2 Depot is the quintessential Voran orbital warehouse, a modular storage hub that quietly keeps entire campaigns alive beyond the Horizon. Arrayed around a reinforced central spine, its pressurized vaults, frozen-lock canisters, and radiation-shielded silos can house everything from unprocessed asteroid ore to VX-grade strike munitions. Automated mag-clamp bays and crane rails shuttle cargo between incoming freighters and outbound task groups with machine precision, overseen by a lean crew and a ruthless scheduling AI that bills every second of dock time. In the early stages of a system’s exploitation, a lone CXW-2 often drifts above a half-built outpost like a promise of prosperity; by the time the grid is fully lit, that same depot has become the quiet heart of the local economy, the place where every crate, every ration, and every shell has passed through at least once.',

Internally, maintenance corridors wind around humming magnetic bottles and radiant baffles, while exterior conduits snake outward to habitats, factories, and defense grids that depend on its constant output. Pulse Cores are designed to survive everything from seismic surges to orbital debris strikes; if a frontier colony is reduced to rubble, surveyors often find the VXG-2 still ticking over, patiently waiting for new orders.

Assembly bays line the station’s outer ring, where articulated arms and EX-series drones snap together engine blocks, armor plates, and subassemblies in a ceaseless ballet of sparks and motion. Each Forge Line carries a curated library of sanctioned blueprints; when higher-priority contracts arrive, its control core can reconfigure entire production chains in hours, tearing down old jigs and spinning up new ones without ever going dark.

Once a site is stripped, the rig retracts its equipment, seals its holds, and races for the next claim—often leaving only scarred soil and the faint heat-signature of spent reactors behind. In the wider Beyond Horizon expansion, DRX-210 packs are the first tangible sign that a region has been targeted for exploitation, arriving quietly ahead of armies and administrators alike.',

    description:
      'The DRX-340 Deepcore is the crown jewel of Orbis Robotics’ DRX line, a colossal extraction platform engineered to crack open the densest asteroid hearts and coax out the rarest minerals sleeping inside. Reinforced fusion drills spear deep into rock strata while seismic destabilizers pre-fracture surrounding material, turning entire planetoids into manageable rubble over months-long campaigns. High-capacity power cells and redundant reactor stacks grant the Deepcore a level of autonomy most mining rigs can only envy; once deployed into a belt, it may not see a drydock for years. Its modular drill assemblies can be swapped or reconfigured mid-mission, allowing Voran planners to pivot from bulk metals to exotic cores as market demands shift. In the mythos of Beyond Horizon’s working crews, serving on a Deepcore is a strange honor: you are as far from civilization as it is possible to be, but you are literally standing on the fortune that fuels it.',

Deeper within, cavernous production bays and refinery stacks allow the Citadel to fabricate ships, weapons, and station modules on a scale rivaling dedicated industrial worlds. Docking arms extend like the branches of a cold metal tree, hosting everything from VX battle lines to merchant convoys eager for corporate contracts. Civilian districts, research enclaves, and executive towers spiral around its central axis, making the Citadel not merely a base, but a mobile capital in its own right.

Raw resources from DRX fleets flow into its hungry maw and emerge as VX warships, armored stations, and entire modular cities ready for deployment. Internal traffic corridors are busy enough to mimic the skies of a minor world—tugs, drones, and EX frames weaving between titanic assemblies suspended in zero-G. To campaign planners, gaining an EXF-9 in theater is like adding a new planet to their roster; to their enemies, the sudden spike in VX hull production attached to a Titan Forge’s signature is often the first and last warning that the balance of power has shifted irrevocably.',

Beneath this accessible façade lies the true machinery of control—data routers that feed citizen metrics to corporate analysts, security coordination rooms that can lock down city districts in minutes, and discreet liaison suites where deals are struck far from public sight. Festivals, protests, and recruitment drives all spiral around the Town Center’s plazas, making it both stage and backdrop for a colony’s social evolution.

Behind opaque glass and security fields, prototypes cycle from raw concept to field-ready hardware, with failures quietly vented into the void or entombed in shielded vaults. Employment here is coveted and dangerous; researchers enjoy privileged housing and access to cutting-edge augmentations, but are bound by deep nondisclosure stacks and the knowledge that some of their work will never see civilian application.
